description: In this tale of revolutionary upheaval in the distant future, Eddie Dirrul
  finds himself caught up in the machinations of an insurgency plot that quickly spirals
  out of control. But in addition to the age-old motivations of power and greed, the
  added elements of ESP and mind control make the situation even more complicated
  and potentially disastrous.
